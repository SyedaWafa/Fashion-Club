First, the shirt has a glittering effect that is guaranteed to draw attention thanks to the exquisite sequin embroidery that covers the entire fabric. A modest V-cut at the round neckline lends an air of sophistication to the design. For an added touch of refinement, the straight, embroidered sleeves include organza trimming and elaborate pearl beading. The shirt also features organza and pearl-detailed panels, as well as a pearl border.
Now let's talk about the pants. They have a straight fit and are really stylish and comfortable. They effortlessly complete the look and go perfectly with the shirt because to their complementing pink dye. They are breathable and lightweight, perfect for any occasion because they are made of cambric cloth.

The dupatta completes the ensemble well and brings it all together. It's dyed the same shade of pink as the shirt and pants, and it has a hint of sparkle thanks to the delicate sequin embroidery. Its ethereal and lightweight organza fabric gracefully falls over the shoulders to finish the ensemble.
