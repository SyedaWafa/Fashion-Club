The kurta has a timeless and adaptable appearance because of its solid color dyeing. It has a collar neckline, which gives the design a more refined feel. The kurta's front looks more polished and streamlined thanks to the concealed placket. It provides a loose and comfy fit thanks to its open cuff and long sleeves. You can easily carry small things with you thanks to the added convenience and usefulness of two side pockets. The kurta's overall simplicity is enhanced by its straight hemline, which makes it simple to wear with various bottoms for a range of styles.

        Now let's talk about the trousers. They are a traditional black color that goes well with the kurta and other tops in your closet. Their straight fit provides a cozy and attractive silhouette. Because they are made to be worn often, they are ideal for daily excursions and pursuits. Because they are made of cotton silk fabric, they feel smooth and soft against the skin, providing comfort all day.
