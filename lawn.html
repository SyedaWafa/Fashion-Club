    Let's start with the shirt and explore the beauty of this ensemble. It's not just any top, though; it's a patterned frock that gives your ensemble a charming touch. It is sophisticated and elegant, especially with its Hyderabadi neckline adorned with embroidery. Musta tassels around the neck offer a whimsical touch, and the scalloped front border is delicately embroidered. The full-length sleeves' loop button design and embroidered borders give the entire ensemble a fashionable touch. The shirt's back is also printed, guaranteeing a put together and fashionable look. It is comfortable and stylish, with a loose fit design.

Now let's talk about the pants. They are made of cambric fabric for a comfortable fit and are colored in a matching off-white color. The embroidered hem adds a delicate yet exquisite touch, and the elasticated waistband guarantees a comfortable fit.


The dupatta, an item with spray embroidery that completes the set, gives the whole look a polished touch. It gives the entire ensemble a refined touch thanks to its four-side embroidered border. It's made of organza cloth, which is light and gives your ensemble a hint of refinement.

It's crucial to remember that in order to preserve the ensemble's quality and look, it should only be dry washed. The model is wearing a size XS, so there's no need to stress about finding the ideal fitâ€”it fits flatteringly on all body shapes.

In conclusion, this ensemble perfectly combines elegance, comfort, and style. From the embroidered dress to the printed one, every element has been carefully planned to enhance your appearance and sense of well-being. Why then wait? Give yourself a treat with this adorable outfit and go out in style.
