        Presenting the MUDMAN, a tough watch made to resist dirt and dust, ideal for people working in hard conditions like motorsports technicians. Its Mud Resist design ensures durability and dependability by sealing out anything from workshop lubricants to motorbike racing sands. Easy reading in the dark is made possible by the Dual Illuminator lighting, which offers a 3- or 5-second afterglow option.

The MUDMAN, which has two 1,000-hour stopwatches, is perfect for timing races and pit stops since it can measure two times at once. An etched picture of a mole, representing the MUDMAN idea, is featured on the back cover.


A 200-meter water resistance, an electroluminescent backlight, a shock-resistant resin/stainless steel case and band, and a flash alert with a buzzer for alarms and alerts are some of the other features. Additionally, the watch resists low temperatures. Its features include 1/100-second stopwatches with auto-start, a countdown timer with auto-repeat, world time for 29 time zones, and five separate multi-function alarms. Hourly time signal, complete auto-calendar, and 12/24-hour format are additional features.

The MUDMAN is dependable for prolonged operation, with a CR2025 battery having a roughly 3-year battery life. Accurate timekeeping and durability are guaranteed by the MUDMAN in any setting, whether you're in the workshop or on the field.
